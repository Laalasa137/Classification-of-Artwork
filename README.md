# Style, Genre and Artist Classification of Artwork

Increase in digitalization of artwork illustrates the importance of
classification of paintings based on artists, styles and the genre of paintings. Classification methodologies will indeed help the visitors as well as the curators in analyzing and visualizing the paintings in any museum at their own pace. Moreover, finding the
artist of a painting is a difficult task because most artworks of an artist may have a exclusive painting style and multiple artists can have same styles of paintings.

## Models
I have experimented with four models -
- Implementation of Vanilla Convolution Neural Network
- Statistical machine learning based approach using Random Forest Classifier by incorporating Visual Bag of Words Technique.
- Implementation of Capsule Networks
- Transfer Learning using pretrained Networks like AlexNet

## Dataset

The dataset for this classification task is Wikiart dataset obtained from reference [Wikiart](https://github.com/cs-chan/ArtGAN/tree/master/WikiArt%20Dataset). The following figure illustrates the distribution of training vs testing images for the dataset.
